# ml-anharmonic-oscillator
This repository contains several Python files for computing the ground state of the one-dimensional quantum anharmonic oscillator using variational Monte Carlo with a neural-network wavefunction. The implementation explores machine learning based variational ansatz to approximate the ground state energy of non-analytical quantum states.
